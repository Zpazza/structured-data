        "\n",
        "Welcome to the ADIA Lab Structural Break Challenge! In this challenge, you will analyze univariate time series data to determine whether a structural break has occurred at a specified boundary point.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Structural Break?\n",
        "\n",
        "A structural break occurs when the process governing the data generation changes at a certain point in time. These changes can be subtle or dramatic, and detecting them accurately is crucial across various domains such as climatology, industrial monitoring, finance, and healthcare.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Structural Break Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crunchdao/competitions/refs/heads/master/competitions/structural-break/quickstarters/baseline/images/example.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your Task\n",
        "\n",
        "For each time series in the test set, you need to predict a score between `0` and `1`:\n",
        "- Values closer to `0` indicate no structural break at the specified boundary point;\n",
        "- Values closer to `1` indicate a structural break did occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation Metric\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation metric is [ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html), which measures the performance of detection algorithms regardless of their specific calibration.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ROC AUC around `0.5`: No better than random chance;\n",
        "- ROC AUC approaching `1.0`: Perfect detection."
